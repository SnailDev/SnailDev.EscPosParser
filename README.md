# ESC/POS command parser
This repository provides command-line utilities for extracting information from binary ESC/POS data. ESC/POS is a page description language that is commonly used for receipt printing.

Currently we have a prototype ESC/POS parser, which can extract the commands contained in printable ESC/POS binary data, and render them to various formats.
